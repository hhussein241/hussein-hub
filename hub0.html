<p>Welcome to my website. My name is <b>Hamza Hussein</b>. I am 18 years old. As of Feb. 16th, 2022, I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science. This website is an early creation I hope to expand on in the near future and see if I can push the limits with HTML. If this website interests you, please feel free to look around the other webpages anchored at the bottom.</p>

<h3>My Hobbies</h3>

<p>It may not blow your mind if I told you some of my main hobbies were video games and programming. In an ideal world, however, I would pursue something more maritime-related -- likely within a submarine. Have a cool picture of one so I can also use the &lt;img&gt; tag:</p>

<h3>The Purpose of this Website</h3>

<p> As mentioned above, this website is just a means for me to study new HTML tags in a sort of "HTML playground" for my computer science course. So far the assignments have been pretty easy, but I'll hold that thought until I complete an assignment involving designing webpages.</p>
